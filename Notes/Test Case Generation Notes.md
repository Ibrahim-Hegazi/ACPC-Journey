## 📘 Why Test Case Generation Matters

Test cases are essential for:

- ✅ Catching hidden bugs
- ✅ Validating your solution on all input ranges
- ✅ Comparing brute-force vs optimized solutions
- ✅ Preparing for contests and interviews

## 🧩 Types of Test Cases to Consider

| Type                 | Description                                     | Example                          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| ✅ Sample Cases       | Provided in the problem statement               | Usually small and simple         |
| 🔄 Edge Cases         | Focus on minimum/maximum values, boundaries     | `n = 0`, `n = 1`, `n = 1e5`      |
| 🔁 Repetitive Values  | Identical or patterned values                   | `[5,5,5]`, `[1,1000,1,1000]`     |
| 🎲 Random Cases       | Generated using randomization                   | Random strings, arrays, trees    |
| 🔍 Worst Case         | Designed to maximize time/memory usage          | Long input, nested loops         |
| 💥 Stress Tests       | Used to compare brute force vs fast solution    | Identify subtle correctness bugs |

## 🛠️ Methods of Test Case Generation

### 1. Manual Testing
- Useful in the early phase.
- Write simple, small examples to understand the problem behavior.
- Helps in visualizing corner cases.

### 2. Scripted Testing
- Use programming scripts to create a wide variety of cases.
- Vary input sizes, values, structures.
- Add randomness for diversity.

### 3. Stress Testing
- Compare a brute-force solution with your optimized one.
- Automatically test until a mismatch is found.
- Useful for catching edge bugs.

### 4. Structured Generators
- Create specific structures (graphs, trees, grids) to test logic.
- Helps in testing problems with special constraints.
- Use deterministic or random approaches depending on goal.

## ✅ Test Generation Best Practices

| Tip                                           | Why it Matters                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ☑ Validate Input Constraints                 | Stay within the problem's limits               |
| ☑ Include All Edge Cases                     | Avoid missed boundaries                        |
| ☑ Use Both Random and Patterned Data         | Test behavior on structured + chaotic input    |
| ☑ Make Tests Reproducible (Optional)         | Use fixed seeds if needed for debugging        |
| ☑ Automate Output Comparison                 | Save time and improve reliability              |
