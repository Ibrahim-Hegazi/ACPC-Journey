# Problem: CF 2096A - Wonderful Sticks

## ‚ùì Idea
- Data Structures(Vector)
- Basic if conditions and loops
- Greedy

## üß† Insight
- Goal: Find any valid arrangement of sticks
- Conditions:
     - The length of each stick is DISTINCT
     - If si = < , then the length of the stick at position i+1 must be smaller than all sticks before it
     - If si = > , then the length of the stick at position i+1 must be larger than all sticks before it
- Greedy: We were greedy here by choosing either the maximum or minimum current number for the indices of the vector from the back

## ‚ùå What I Did Wrong
- Stored the answer in a string instead of a vector, which limited the possible number at each index to 0 - 9

## ‚úÖ Takeaway
- Greedy approach is deadly, happily the pattern was easy to detect from the sample inputs and outputs; This topic needs more training.
